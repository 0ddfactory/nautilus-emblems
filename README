HOW TO CREATE A NEW THEME
=========================
Folder color will work (you'll see the entry menu) if AT LEAST exists the icon: "blue-color".
You can use any compatible icon format (like SVG or PNG).



1. FOLDER COLORS (MANDATORY)
Icon nomenclature: folder-<color>.
<color>: brown, blue, green, grey, orange, pink, red, purple, yellow, cyan, black, violet, magenta

The unique mandatory color is blue. The other are optionals.

For example: Blue folder color would be: /usr/share/icons/<MyAwesomeTheme>/48x48/<places>/folder-blue.svg

OTHER ICONS:
The entries menu will use these icons from the default theme: gtk-edit & undo



2. DEFAULT FOLDERS (OPTIONAL)
These folders have icons inside. They are: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates, Videos.

Icon nomenclature: folder-<color>-<emblem>
<color>: brown, blue, green, grey, orange, pink, red, purple, yellow, cyan, black, violet, magenta
<emblem>: desktop, documents, downloads, music, pictures, public, templates, videos

For example, the blue 'Pictures' folder would be: /usr/share/icons/<MyAwesomeTheme>/48x48/<places>/folder-blue-pictures.svg



3. EMBLEMS (OPTIONAL)
Folder Color will use any of these standard emblems from the current theme:
 - emblem-favorite
 - emblem-important
 - emblem-new
 - emblem-urgent



4. CUSTOM COLOR (OPTIONAL)
Icon nomenclature: folder-custom.svg.

It has to be SVG format.

This icon is not using colors, it's using 3 constants inside the file. Then, when the user choose a custom color, Folder Color is replacing those constants as:
    #value_light  = Color selected by user in hexadecimal.
    #value_middle = Color selected by user in hexadecimal - 2500
    #value_dark   = Color selected by user in hexadecimal - 5000



5. CUSTOM COLOR FOR DEFAULT FOLDERS (OPTIONAL)
Icon nomenclature: folder-custom-<emblem>.svg
<emblem>: desktop, documents, downloads, music, pictures, public, templates, videos

They has to be SVG format.

Icon on Folder Color entry menu will use the 'gtk-edit' icon from default theme.

For example, the 'Pictures' folder would be: /usr/share/icons/<MyAwesomeTheme>/48x48/<places>/folder-custom-pictures.svg



6. ALL RESOLUTIONS (OPTIONAL)
Reply the previous sections for all resolutions (not only 48px) in points 1, 2 and 3.








HOW TO CHECK YOUR NEW THEME?
Copy your icons into:
    ~/.icons/<your_theme>/
After install them, remember to refresh your theme:
    # gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.icons/<your_theme>
Set your theme as default system theme.
And restart your file browser:
    $ [nautilus|caja|nemo] -q




MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION
Make all the icons is a really big work.
I'd recommend you to create just the icons of point 1. If you are full of beans, create the other.
